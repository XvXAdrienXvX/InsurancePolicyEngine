**Insurance System Workflow**

### 1. Create a PolicyType
Defines the available types of policies (e.g., Auto, Health, Home).
**Endpoint:** POST /policy-types
**Request:**
- Name: "Auto Insurance"
- Description: "Covers vehicle damages and liability."

### 2. Create a Contract
A Contract is an agreement between the insurer and the insured, governing multiple policies over a period.
**Endpoint:** POST /contracts
**Request:**
- Contract Number: "CN-123456"
- Holder Name: "John Doe"
- Start Date: "2025-01-01"
- End Date: "2030-01-01"

### 3. Add Policies to a Contract
Each policy is issued under a contract and has a PolicyType.
**Endpoint:** POST /contracts/{contractId}/policies
**Request:**
- Policy Type ID: "AUTO"
- Policy Holder: "John Doe"
- Premium Amount: 600.00

### 4. Retrieve All Policies Under a Contract
Allows clients to see their covered policies.
**Endpoint:** GET /contracts/{contractId}/policies
**Response Example:**
- Contract Number: "CN-123456"
- Holder Name: "John Doe"
- Policies:
  - Policy ID: "P123", Policy Type: "Auto", Premium: 600
  - Policy ID: "P124", Policy Type: "Health", Premium: 1200

### 5. Submit a Claim for a Policy
Claims must be linked to a policy.
**Endpoint:** POST /claims
**Request:**
- Policy ID: "P123"
- Claim Number: "C987654"
- Description: "Car accident"
- Amount: 5000
- Status: "Pending"

### 6. Update Claim Status
Allows insurers to process claims.
**Endpoint:** PUT /claims/{claimId}
**Request:**
- Status: "Approved"

### 7. Retrieve a Claim
Allows policyholders to track claim status.
**Endpoint:** GET /claims/{claimId}
**Response Example:**
- Claim ID: "C987654"
- Policy ID: "P123"
- Description: "Car accident"
- Amount: 5000
- Status: "Approved"

### Summary
- Contract can have multiple policies.
- Each policy has its own PolicyType.
- Claims are tied to policies.
- Workflow is structured for easy implementation following DDD principles.

### Next Steps
1. Implement event-driven approach with Kafka/HiveMQ for claim status updates.
2. Design repository pattern for contracts & policies.
3. Integrate Payment module for policy premiums.
